                <p>I know I’m bad at communication and expressing my feelings and we haven't been as close as we used to be and it feels like were drifting apart lately or thats how I feel atleast, but still I wanted you to know how much I still value you and our friendship.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know if you still remember the day we first actually stated talking. I had replied to your facebook story related to one piece story with "Umaru chan your a pirate too?" and you replied with something like ayyy or arrrr with a Zehahahaha meme of Oda in Blackbeard ko luga. Ani after that you started asking me random questions like my age and studies like you we interviewing me cus you were just about join BBS at that time and you were curious about Business studies and yea you didn't believe me when I said im Akuma. All that might sound kinda cringe or silly to you now but that same silliness of yours and what others may call your flaws is what made me interested in you. </p>
                
                <p>It's been a long time since that day and a lot has happened in these 4+ years. A lot of laughs, cries, panic and stress and we have come a long way since that day. I also remember the first time you asked me to send my pic, ngl u were the first person who had asked me for my pic and i was panicking and i didnt have any photos of in mine in my gallery so i just clicked it and sent it to you and you were like i look older than u expected 😭. You may not realize it but since that day you have a <span class="text-white font-bold">HUGE</span> part of my life since then.</p>
                
                <p>If i could go back into the past I would still choose to reply to that story in any timeline.</p>
                
                <p>Im running out of words and I think this is getting longer than I thought so, in the end I just wanted to say you are still the person who I value a <Strong>LOTTT</Strong> and <Strong>CHERISH</Strong> in my life and someone who I never want to lose and I hope that no matter what happens we never end up in a bad term and go our seperate ways.</p>
